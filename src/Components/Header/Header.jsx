/*
<Link>

. A <Link> is an element that lets the user navigate to another page by clicking or tapping on it.

. The to prop specifies the location to which the user will be redirected after clicking on the <Link>.

. Rendering a <Link> will insert an anchor tag (<a>) in your HTML document, but the anchor's default behavior (triggering a page reload) will be disabled.


<NavLink>

. A <NavLink> is a special kind of <Link> that knows whether or not it is "active" or "pending".

Â· This is useful when building a navigation menu, such as a breadcrumb or a set of tabs where you'd like to show which of them is currently selected.
